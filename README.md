# mission-to-mars
In this module we are creating a web page app that can obtain the most current information from a variety of websites about mars at the click of a button. The data includes, news articles, images and stats. Using Flask, Python, Jupyter notebook, BeautifulSoup, Mongo, Splinter, and a few other items, we were able to create a code to scrape data from websites, add them to a database, and then extract that information from the database and present it as a web page HTML.
